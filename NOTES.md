## Deferred — Do Not Implement

| Issue | Status | Action |
|---|---|---|
| Image cleanup (old Supabase Storage files orphaned on replace/delete) | Deferred | Acceptable for now |
| Cascade delete on `voucher_packages.menu_item_id` | Unresolved | Do NOT add cascade. Ask architect. |
| Hard delete `menu_item` while active vouchers reference it | Deferred | Soft delete only. Ask before any hard delete. |
| Order ready notification (Zalo ZNS via ESMS) | Phase 5 | Alongside OTP |
| Admin first user | Manual | Create via Supabase dashboard. No seed, no setup route. |
| SEO sitemap + robots.txt | After Phase 2 | Next.js built-in. No external library. |
| Structured data JSON-LD | After Phase 2 | Add to menu item pages for product schema. |
| **Mix bột Fusion** | Deferred | min_gram = `default_size_config[size].powder_gram`. max = min + 4g. Free allocation across available powders. Schema: add `is_mix_powder Boolean @default(false)` on `order_items` + new table `order_item_powder_blend (id, order_item_id FK, powder_id FK, grams Decimal, snapshot_price_per_gram Int)`. Additive — safe to add later. |
| **Mix bột Latte** | Deferred | Must keep minimum 2g of the item's fixed powder. Different constraint from Fusion. Same schema additions as Fusion mix. |
| **Per-item milk exclusions** | Deferred | If a Latte item should exclude certain milk types, add `menu_item_milk_exclusions (menu_item_id FK, milk_type_id FK)`. Do not implement until confirmed needed. |
| **Ice option pricing** | Deferred | Ice options are free columns on `order_items`. If any option ever needs a charge, it must move to the addon system. Confirm with business before implementing. |
| **`default_size_config` audit log** | Deferred | No audit trail when admin edits M/L/XL config. If needed: add `updated_at` + `updated_by` columns. Changes apply globally and immediately — admin is responsible. |
| **`PRICE_CHANGED` mid-session edge case** | Not a concern | Admin updates prices at night when shop is closed. No real-time mitigation needed beyond reject + conflict response. |

## Backend Separation — Migration Path

> Current: fullstack Next.js — intentional for fast shipping.
> Do NOT pre-optimize or add abstraction layers.
> Only follow this if architect explicitly decides to separate.

If separation becomes necessary:
1. Move `app/api/*` → standalone Express / Fastify / Hono app
2. Move `lib/prisma.ts`, `lib/auth.ts`, `lib/validations/`, `lib/sms.ts`, `lib/storage.ts`, `lib/pricing.ts` → BE repo
3. `src/utils/pricing.ts` stays in frontend — pure functions, no deps
4. In `src/services/*` — swap base URL from `/api` to external URL. No other changes needed.
5. Frontend becomes pure static/SSG Next.js calling external API.

Works cleanly because:
- All business logic isolated in `lib/` — not scattered in components
- `src/services/` is the only layer that knows where data comes from
- `src/utils/pricing.ts` has no server deps — survives separation cleanly
- API contract `{ data: T }` / `{ error, code }` is consistent throughout
